## Basic of Swift
You’ll need to know a bit about Swift before you begin, so start by reviewing The Basics of the Swift programming language for an overview of syntax, data types, and unique language features, such as optionals. 

Also review the Closures section because you’ll use them frequently in SwiftUI.

## SwiftUI Overview
SwiftUI is a declarative framework for building apps for any Apple platform. 
Use SwiftUI to define the UI and behavior of an app using a single language and common API.
Define what views appear on screen using simple Swift structures. 
Your views stay up to date automatically.

## Using Stacks
### VStack
A vertical stack, which shows views in a top-to-bottom list
